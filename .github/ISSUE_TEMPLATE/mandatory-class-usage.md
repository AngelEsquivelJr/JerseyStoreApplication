# Mandatory Classes    
Separate code from data in a way that code resides in functions whose behavior does not depend on data that is somehow encapsulated in the functionâ€™s context. 

When we separate code and data, it is straightforward to reuse code in different contexts.  

**The three required/Mandatory classes are:**

**clsLogon.cs** - Handles all validation of the user before reaching the server (form level validation)      

- [ ]  Uses the validation class to Validates user ID according  to the User/Logon ID requirements stated earlier    
- [ ]  Uses the validation class to Validates password according to the User/Logon ID requirements stated earlier    
  
**clsValidation.cs** - Handles input validation for controls or user input before reaching the server   

- [ ]  Validate TextBox input of required fields    

> - [ ]  Phone number    
> - [ ]  Date
> - [ ]  Zip Code
> - [ ]  ...etc 

- [ ]  Handles all other general validations
  
**clsSQL.cs** - Handles connections, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, and SELECT    

- [ ]  Efficient code that uses a minimal amount of methods/functions for connecting to the 
database.  
- [ ]  Efficient code that uses a minimal amount of methods/functions for handling data 
manipulation.  
- [ ]  Efficient code that uses a minimal amount of methods/functions for querying the 
database.  
- [ ]  Efficient code that uses a minimal amount of methods/functions for handling SQL 
Exceptions. 
- [ ]  Handles all other SQL Interactions

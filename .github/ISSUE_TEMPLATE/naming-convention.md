All Objects, Variables, Forms, Procedures, Classes, Controls, etc. will be named with **meaningful names** for what they do, what data they hold, etc. They will also be named using **Hungarian notation** where appropriate with **Pascal case** (aka: Upper CamelCase) and to course naming standards (see Moodle). 

Examples: 
```intLoopCounter, decMoneyPaid, strFirstName, btnClickMe, lblLastNamePrompt, GetLastName(), SetFirstName(strFirstName), frmInventory, clsDataConnections.```

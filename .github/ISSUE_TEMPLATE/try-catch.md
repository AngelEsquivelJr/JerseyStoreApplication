## **Exception Handling**
 
- [ ] Unhandled Exceptions must be appropriately handled using a Try/Catch or Try/Catch/Finally to avoid program crashes which will result in course failure. 

- [ ] Try/Catch or Try/Catch/Finally statements must not have empty code blocks { } in any of the code blocks. 

- [ ] The “Catch” portion of the statement must provide appropriate and professional feedback/actions for the user.

- [ ] Try/Catch and Try/Catch/Finally statements are not to be used as Validation   Methods.

Examples: 
- Areas with formulas and calculations (Divide by 0 errors, NaN, etc.)
- Database (SQL) connections/access, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
- File I/O, Permission Issues, Pathing Errors, etc. 
- Code using subscripts such as **For** Loops
- DataGridView - Subscript usage with rows and/or columns, etc.

# AE Sporting Fits
A store application that will be used to buy sports jerseys.

## Detailed Description

This will be a store application where you can buy sporting jerseys. A customer will be able to create an account, login, and then shop for their desired jersey. The customer will have a cart to add items, and then checkout once they are ready to buy. Receipts will be generated with every order. The manager will have an internal application where they can produce reports, purchase items for the stock, and manage the customers, employees, and inventory. The scope of the application is that you will be able to buy Jerseys from various sporting leagues, varying in sizes from small, medium, and large. The limitations of my application are not every sporting jersey in the world will be available, there won't be any extra small size, and there won't be any extra large sizes. The best way for me to avoid scope creep will be by avoiding adding more than just jerseys, and make sure my application is running well before adding anything extra that I didn't have initially planned.

### Project Introduction

- The Project creates a store application used for shopping.
- The goal is to create an easy to use app that can be reliable for finding jerseys.
- The project will be designed to be as user friendly and as easy to use as possible.
- The search feature will be useful to find whatever specific item you need. The sorted items will also make it simple to find
  an item.
- The project is currently in the beginning of its development cycle, and currently only has a logon view implemented.

### Development Plan - Time Table

#### Below is the development time table and planned benchmarks/milestones to accomplish this project by the due date.

- **Logon View**

  My desired completion date for the Logon View will be the 2nd of February. I will use a couple days to design the view, the next 2 weeks to implement the code, and the remaining time to fix any problems and check validation. My main objective is to give myself time to make sure my Logon system works properly and doesn't break with user input.

- **Customer View**

  My desired completion date for the Customer View will be the 23rd of February. I will take about one week to design the view, the next week to implement the code, and the remaining time to fix any problems. I will take more time in design to ensure that this part of the application is as user friendly as possible. 

- **Manager View**

  My desired completion date for the Manager View will be the 25th of March. This time, less time will be used to design the view, about 4 days, then the next 2 weeks to implement the code, and the remaining time to fix any problems. I will take more time on the code here as I believe this view will require more work than the others.

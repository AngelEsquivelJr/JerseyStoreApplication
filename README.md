# AE Sporting Fits
A store application that will be used to buy sports jerseys.

## Detailed Description

The projects end goal is to have a store application where you can buy sporting jerseys. A customer will be able to create an account, login, and then shop for their desired jersey. The customer will have a cart to add items, and then checkout once they are ready to buy. Receipts will be generated with every order. The manager will have an internal application where they can produce reports, purchase items for the stock, and manage the customers, employees, and inventory. The scope of my project is limited to the due date for the project. Therefore, my scope can not be to ambitious and not to overwhelming. The limitations of the project are managing my time properly, focusing on doing everything properly by following all requirements, and not slacking off. The best way for me to avoid scope creep will be to follow my own proposal as well as stick to the recommended due dates given.

### Project Introduction

- The Project creates a store application used for shopping.
- The goal is to create an easy to use app that can be reliable for finding jerseys.
- The project will be designed to be as user friendly and as easy to use as possible.
- The search feature will be useful to find whatever specific item you need. The sorted items will also make it simple to find
  an item.
- The project is currently in the beginning of its development cycle.

### Development Plan - Time Table

#### Below is the development time table and planned benchmarks/milestones to accomplish this project by the due date.

- **Logon View**

  My desired completion date for the Logon View will be the 2nd of February. One week will be used to design the view, the next week to implement the code, and the remaining time to fix any problems. By focusing on finishing earlier than the expected due date, I will then be able to fix any mistakes that I may have after submitting.

- **Customer View**

  My desired completion date for the Customer View will be the 23rd of February. Again one week will be used to design the view, the next week to implement the code, and the remaining time to fix any problems. Again by focusing on finishing earlier than the expected due date, I will then be able to fix any mistakes that I may have after submitting.

- **Manager View**

  My desired completion date for the Manager View will be the 25th of March. This time, less time will be used to design the view, about 4 days, then the next 2 weeks to implement the code, and the remaining time to fix any problems. Again by focusing on finishing earlier than the expected due date, I will then be able to fix any mistakes that I may have after submitting. I will take more time on the code here as I believe this view will require more work than others.
